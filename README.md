# ðŸŒ¾ Intelligent Crop Recommendation System

**Machine Learning & IoT-integrated crop recommendation system** built with **Flask**, **Random Forest**, and **ESP32-based sensors**.  
This system predicts the most suitable crop for cultivation based on soil nutrients (N, P, K), pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall, providing **real-time recommendations** to farmers.

## System Architecture

The system integrates IoT sensors with a machine learning model:

1. Sensors capture real-time soil and environmental data.  
2. **ESP32** microcontroller transmits sensor data via Wi-Fi.  
3. **Flask server** receives the data and runs the Random Forest model.  
4. Predicted crop recommendations are displayed on a **web/mobile dashboard**.

**Components:**  
- Random Forest ML model for multi-class crop prediction  
- IoT sensors: NPK, pH, temperature, humidity, **rainfall**  
- Flask backend with MySQL/SQLite database  
- Frontend dashboard with dynamic visualizations using Matplotlib/Plotly

## Hardware Setup

- **ESP32 Microcontroller** â€“ collects and sends data via Wi-Fi  
- **NPK Sensor** â€“ measures soil nutrients  
- **pH Sensor** â€“ measures soil acidity  
- **DHT22 Sensor** â€“ measures temperature & humidity  
- **Rainfall Sensor** â€“ measures precipitation levels  
- **Power supply & wiring** â€“ for continuous operation
