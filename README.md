# Intelligent Crop Recommendation System ðŸŒ¾

A **web and IoT-integrated crop recommendation system** built using **Flask**, **Random Forest**, and **ESP32-based sensors**.  
This system predicts the most suitable crop for cultivation based on soil nutrients (N, P, K), pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall, delivering **real-time recommendations** to farmers.

**Additional Notes:**  
- Model trained using an 80:20 train-test split with 10-fold cross-validation.  
- Outliers handled with interquartile range filtering, missing values imputed, and features normalized.  
- Top features selected based on Gini index importance.

## System Architecture

The system integrates IoT-enabled sensors with a machine learning model:

1. Sensors capture real-time soil and environmental data.
2. **ESP32** microcontroller transmits sensor data via Wi-Fi.
3. **Flask server** receives the data and runs the Random Forest model.
4. Predicted crop recommendations are displayed on a **web/mobile dashboard**.

**Components:**  
- Random Forest ML model for multi-class crop prediction  
- IoT sensors for soil nutrients, pH, temperature, and humidity  
- Flask-based backend with MySQL or SQLite database  
- Frontend dashboard with dynamic visualizations using Matplotlib/Plotly

## Hardware Setup

- **ESP32 Microcontroller** for data acquisition and Wi-Fi transmission  
- **NPK Sensor** to measure soil nutrients  
- **pH Sensor** for soil acidity  
- **DHT22 Sensor** for temperature and humidity  
- **Power supply** and communication wiring for continuous operation
